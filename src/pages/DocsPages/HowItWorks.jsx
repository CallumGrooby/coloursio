<p>Colours.io has a few main sections: the Playground, the Colour Contrast tool, and this docs section.</p>

<h3>Playground
</h3>

<p>The Playground is where you build and test your palette. You can change colours, pick fonts, and see how everything looks in real time. It’s set up to look like a typical landing page, with sections like a hero, about, pricing, testimonials, footer, and a call to action. This way you can see how your palette works across a full layout, not just a single block.
<br/>
It gives you a much better sense of how your choices will work once you’re actually designing something.</p>

<h2>Colour Contrast
</h2>
<p>This is where you can test if your colours are accessible. It checks if your text has enough contrast against the background using standard accessibility rules. That’s super helpful when you’re trying to use lighter shades or muted colours and want to make sure everything is still readable.
<br/>
You don’t need to calculate anything yourself. Just plug in your colours and see the results.</p>
